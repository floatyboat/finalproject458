## Introduction

Access to healthcare is a hot button topic in the United States. Even as the Affordable Care Act exists, many Americans still lack health insurance. In this first world country, that means that one could possibly go broke attempting to get the proper care they need. Another big issue is the class divide in this country between the rich and the poor, which far too frequently is linked to a person’s race. Especially during our current time like this, these two issues combine to create an inequality in health.

While there are many factors—too many to cover in one map—that contribute to this inequality, this project attempts to visually display this inequality using existing government census and healthcare data. This map will aim to show some factors that lead to an inequality of health outcomes between white people and people of color, and the inherent racism that exists throughout the United States, using California as an example. Namely, environmental racism—or the idea that policy and practice have forced Black people, Indigenous people, and people of color (BIPOCs) to live in areas hazardous to their health—can be shown through these maps. Not just environment in the sense of the condition of the environment around the BIPOCs in the studied areas, but also the healthcare options available to them in their area. This will be shown through the relative healthcare accessibility of areas with a large proportion of BIPOC population compared to the  healthcare accessibility of areas with populations that are majority white.

This factor—access to healthcare—are linked. With the poorer environmental conditions due to environmental racism leading to worse health outcomes for BIPOCs, not having adequate access to healthcare compounds this problem. These maps will look to show that problem among areas with large BIPOC populations. The source of this problem could be from many factors—aside from the residual racism that exists in the United States that never left from slavery and Jim Crowe era. As mentioned before, a class divide exists that is heavily intertwined with race. This leads to a lack of investment and regulation in these areas that are inhabited by a large proportion of BIPOCs, which creates these environmental inequalities. Specifically, this problem starts to show its head in California in the more sparsely populated counties.

## Goal

The ultimate goal of this map would be to support these communities through the presentation of data in a geographical format to illuminate these disparities. The purpose of this map is to add to the discourse around racial inequality in the United States of America in hopes of educating the general public on many of the issues with how this country is currently constructed. Hopefully, this map can show people the disparities that exist across the country by showing the problems in a state that is known for being more progressive than the average American state.
